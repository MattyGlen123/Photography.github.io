# Real Cumbria
This project is a template site for a local photographer and a chance for me to develope my skills.

## Motivation
I've designed and made the project to convince a local photographer that I can create a new and improved website for his business.
His current site isn't responsive and doesnâ€™t highlight his work. I've created the landing page template to give a taste of the final design.

### TODO
Subpages will be included:
* A page for each of the photo albums (4 at the moment), which will include a slider to view all the images
* Another page dedicated to the process of producing the photograph in a dark room. Will include a video.

## For developers
Install project dependencies:

$ npm install

Start the app:

$ npm start

Build app:
